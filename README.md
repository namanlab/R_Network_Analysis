# Network Analysis with `tidygraph` and `ggraph` in R

Welcome to the **Network Analysis** project repository! This project explores techniques for performing and visualizing network analysis in R using the powerful `tidygraph` and `ggraph` packages. The repository contains Quarto documents, presentation slides, and other supporting materials to guide users through the concepts and examples.
